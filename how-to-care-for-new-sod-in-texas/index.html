<p>Texas Best Lawn Care on Lawn maintenance, Lawn care, Lawn You’ve invested in new sod for a new lawn, and you want to care for it properly. Lawn care faqs, especially for new sod by randy lemmon apr 12, 2018 considering the many questions i’ve received recently about replacing sod after harvey’s floods, sod webworms and our twin freezes, i figured an faq sheet might be in order. Always monitor the new lawn health every day, and during the day if possible for the first week or two at least, and always be ready to apply an extra watering as is required, and at any time the new saint augustine sod shows any sign of stress or wilting or other poor lawn health developing. As with seed, buying certified sod, if available, is the best way to be sure you are getting the stated variety. Lawn care should include proper mowing, fertilization, watering and irrigation, aeration, weed management, and the correct sod for the region.</p>
