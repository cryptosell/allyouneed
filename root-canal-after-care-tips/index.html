<p>Are There Hidden Dangers to Getting a Root Canal? Root It’s important not to attempt to eat until the numbness has worn off from your mouth after your root canal procedure. Take care of your teeth by brushing, flossing, regular checkups and cleanings and be sure to return to your dentist and/or endodontist if you experience pain or swelling in the future. However, it would help if you were careful. Root canal treatment may resolve your symptoms, such as swelling. Take prescription medications as directed even if you do not feel pain after your procedure, it is strongly recommended to take any and all prescription medications that your dentist has prescribed exactly as directed.</p>
