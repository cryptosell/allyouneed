You can practice self care by taking the time to pamper yourself with a bath, a facial or a pedicure and a manicure. Try to find (even a hint of) humor in every situation (or, at the very least, dish out a few silly jokes) to keep your daughter smiling.</p>

<p>Pin on Back to School Ideas For a quick snack, try recharging with a pear, apple, or banana; Being mentally healthy is also key to being the best teenage girl you can be. Stop taking everything so seriously, learn to let go, to walk away, and if you could learn to want what you deserve that’ll help you too. This is the most important season you will endure because you are learning about yourself, and understanding how to care for, guard, and nourish the soft spots and hard places within who you are. Try to find (even a hint of) humor in every situation (or, at the very least, dish out a few silly jokes) to keep your daughter smiling.</p>
