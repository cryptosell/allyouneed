<p>Why Does Grass Turn Yellow In Winter? in 2020 Winter Heat builds up into stacked sod, and your lawn is going to be thirsty now that it’s finally on the ground. Delaying the first cutting allows for too much shading, blade widening and possible sunburn. In the winter you may need to wait longer for the roots to establish prior to mowing. If you see snow mold, rake the lawn to loosen matted grass and allow the grass to dry out. After the sod has fully rooted (approximately 3 weeks), regular mowing can commence.</p>
