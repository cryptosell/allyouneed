<p>Although applying temporary eyelash extensions is fairly You might think keeping your lash extensions dry is smart, but they actually stay nicer, longer, when they�re oiled up (this helps keep them flexible). They come in many different sizes ranging from six millimeters to 18 millimeters. When we give our clients advice on how to take care of eyelash extensions, brushing is always on the list. That includes pulling at your eyes (you know, when you’re doing your makeup), scratching, scrubbing when you take your makeup off, rubbing your eyes because you’re tired or because they itch, etc. Learn how to care for eyelash extensions in the summer months here.</p>
