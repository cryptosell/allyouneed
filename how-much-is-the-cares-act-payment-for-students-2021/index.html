<p>Student Loan Relief Extended to 2021 — Future Proof M.D We estimate that the average rebate amount among all filers will be $1,729. The rebate amount (among those that receive a rebate) varies by income. As of january 22, 2021, $702,650 in emergency financial aid grants have been distributed to students under section 18004(a)(1) of the cares act. Under the act, universities must spend at least as much money on direct aid to students as they did with cares act funds, which would equal a minimum of $7.6 million in direct aid to students. However, when the 2021 tax season opens, many young adults could qualify for a combined $1,800 ($1,200 from the cares act and $600 from the second round of economic impact payments).</p>
