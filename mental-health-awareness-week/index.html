During mental health awareness week and beyond, we�ll continue listening to you to make sure we�re focusing on the issues that matter so we can make sure that the government understands the impact of this pandemic on our mental health. Many people do not seek treatment in the early stages of mental illnesses because they don�t recognize the symptoms. To mark the week, join us by taking part in the kindness challenge! 2020 mental health awareness calendar there are many great events and campaigns in the coming year related to mental health, and we at sacwellness want to help ourselves and others easily find them!</p>

<p>Mental Health Awareness Week Tips For Creatives Learning The week is a chance for us all to build on the things we’ve been doing to look after ourselves, and to reimagine. It�s the mental illness awareness week, held during the first week of october every year to raise awareness of mental illiness. For five fantastic years, mental health week was synonymous with #getloud! It has been a stressful and difficult year for obvious reasons and we just need to let the staff know that there are many ways to help us all get through this. The international mental health awareness week takes place from 13th to 19th may every year and it’s when the world joins to show support and experience on mental health issues in our communities.</p>
