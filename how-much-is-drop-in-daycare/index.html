<p>Do you know how much work goes into every drop of clean If you’re wanting to drop off fido for a full day of fun, you can expect to pay $28 to $40. You can use it to see photos, find out when, what, and how much they ate, and even when they went to the bathroom (details about what was in the diaper and all). Daycare late pick up fee. A family with one child in a daycare facility would need to make at least $97,000 in order to keep daycare costs at 10% of their income on average. I charge $40.00 a day for children, 2 and under, and $35.00 a day for 2 and up.</p>
