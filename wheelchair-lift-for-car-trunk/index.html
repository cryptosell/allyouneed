<p>XL 60&quot; x 29&quot; Wheelchair Scooter Mobility Folding Hitch Take a firm hold of the wheelchair rims, tilt the wheelchair towards you slightly and lift in one smooth movement. This means that not only does it lift the chair off the ground and onto the floor of the vehicle, but it also places the chair inside the car without having to remove the chair from the device. This wheelchair hoist is driven by electric actuator and max loading capacity can reach 100kg. In this example the post itself will take up 4 inches of width while loading, and must. After that, some manual adjusting is all it takes for you to begin traveling.</p>
