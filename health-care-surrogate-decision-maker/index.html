(incapacity is defined as the physical or mental inability to manage your affairs.) A surrogate decision maker, also known as a health care proxy or as agents, is an advocate for incompetent patients. New hampshire’s new “surrogate decision maker law” took effect on january 1st. A surrogate decision maker shall make decisions for the patient conforming as closely as possible to what the patient would have done or intended under the circumstances, taking into account evidence that includes, but is not limited to, the patient�s personal, philosophical, religious, and moral beliefs and ethical values relative to the purpose of life, sickness, medical procedures, suffering, and death.</p>
