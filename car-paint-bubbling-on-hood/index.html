<h3 id="by-jeep-posted-on-january-31-2021">By jeep posted on january 31, 2021.</h3><p>On a 26 month old vehicle? “bubbling and blistering can be caused by rain if the paint hasn’t had enough time to dry before a storm moves in, but in many cases once the sun comes out the bubbles disappear,” he says. A sort of pinhole effect. It can spread underneath the coating, capitalizing on voids in an adhesive or an inconsistent oxide layer on the substrate, the trade group suggested in an october 2017 study of a bubbling hood paint job. The complaint claims that the “defect in the paint, which was present upon delivery, manifests itself over time, causes the paint to bubble, peel and flake off of the vehicle, and can lead to rusting and corrosion.”.</p>
