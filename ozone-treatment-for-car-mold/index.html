<p>Pin by Negative Ion Generator Store on https//alphaionic The ozone generator is placed in your vehicle, allowing the gas to permeate your car, neutralizing odors, and attacking any bacteria, viruses, mold or other pathogens that might exist on surfaces that the gas comes into contact with. Clearing away the mold is always a part of the process. After shutting off the ozone generator, you must wait an hour or two for the ozone to completely settle. Put this mixture in a clean spray bottle. As the gas permeates your car, the odor is neutralized and any bacteria and viruses are killed.</p>
